# RMarkdown ***editing***



R Markdown documents provide quick, reproducible reporting from R. You write your document in markdown and embed executable R code chunks with the knitr syntax. You can update your document at any time by re-knitting the code chunks. You can then convert your document into several common formats.



[RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html)


```{r}

library(knitr)


fastfood <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-09-04/fastfood_calories.csv')

fastfood%>%
head(10)
  
 
kable(fastfood[1:10, 1:5])

fastfood%>% 
filter(calories>1000)  


dont_eat_this<-fastfood%>% 
filter(total_fat>40 & total_carb>80)

fastfood%>% 
filter(restaurant=="Mcdonalds")


```
